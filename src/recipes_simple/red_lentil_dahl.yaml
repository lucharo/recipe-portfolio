servings: 4
ingredients:
  - 1 tbsp of oil
  - 1 large onion
  - 4 cloves of garlic
  - 2 tbsps fresh ginger
  - 2 teaspoons garam masala
  - 0.5 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  - 1 tsp red chili pepper flakes
  - 2 tsp ground turmeric
  - 2 tsp salt
  - 1 tsp ground black pepper
  - 3 cups of water
  - 400 grams of red lentils
  - 1 can of tomatoes
  - 1 can of coconut milk
methods:
  - Dice onions and garlic and finely chop (or grate) ginger until you get paste
  - Combine all spices into a spice mix.
  - Put oil in a pot, once hot, add onions.
  - Once the onions have browned, add garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant (add
    more oil if necessary). Stir and make sure the content of the pot does not stick to the bottom.
  - Add the spice mix into the pot and stir until combined. Again, try and prevent sticking to the bottom.
  - Add water to the pot and mix, make sure to scratch the bottom of the pot
    with a wooden spoon to avoid burning at the bottom.
  - Add the red lentils, tomatoes, and coconut milk to the pot.
  - Bring the mix to a boil and stir throughout.
  - Once boiling, bring down to a simmer, cover and let it cook for 15-20 minutes.
notes:
  - DO NOT scale chilli flakes linearly with the servings scaling
  - I don't soak my red lentils but rinsing them can be a good idea
  - Keep stirring initially as onions have a tendency to stick to the bottom and might burn your whole dahl
