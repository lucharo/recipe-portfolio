  - For the rice noodles I use the Udon Noodles by Yutaka (https://yutaka.london/products/noodles/udon-noodles-250g/)
  - If not using babycorn, feel free to replace babycorn for more mushrooms
  - I like to cook the soup and noodles separately to have the option to have the soup on its own or with noodles
