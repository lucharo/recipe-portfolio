servings: 4
ingredients:
  - 4 red peppers
  - 1 onion
  - 4 garlic cloves
  - 50 g cashews
  - 300 g spaghetti
  - 1 cup of pasta water
  - 250 ml unsweetened plant-based milk
  - 1 tbsp dried mixed herbs
  - 50 g sun-dried tomatoes in oil
  - 1 tsp balsamic vinegar
  - 3 tbsp nutritional yeast
  - 1 tsp of salt 
  - 1 tsp pepper
  - 1 handful of fresh basil (optional)
  - 1 tbsp of toasted cashews (optional)
  - 1 tsp of red chilli flakes (optional)
methods:
  - Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
  - Transfer the cashews to a bowl and cover in hot water straight from a kettle. Leave on one side to soak.
  - Remove the stem of the red peppers and cut the onion(s) in quarters.
  - Add the red peppers to a roasting tray and roast for 15 minutes.
  - Remove the tray from the oven. Add the quartered onions and garlic cloves and return to the oven for another 15 minutes.
  - Cook the pasta in boiling salted water as per packet instructions and make sure you reserve some pasta water (1 cup for every 4 servings of this dish).
  - Leave the roasted veggies to cool for 5 minutes. Then peel the onion and garlic, and remove any skin and any remaining stalks or seeds from the red peppers. Transfer them to a blender.
  - Drain the cashews and add them to the blender, along with the plant-based milk and pasta water you reserved earlier, dried mixed herbs, sun-dried tomatoes (drain as much oil as possible), balsamic vinegar, nutritional yeast, and very generous pinches of salt and pepper
  - Blend until smooth.
  - Pour the sauce into a large saucepan on a low-medium heat. Gently heat the sauce, then add the spaghetti.
  - Top with basil, toasted cashews, and chilli flakes.
notes:
  - If you don't have dried mixed herbs, use something like oregano or thyme
