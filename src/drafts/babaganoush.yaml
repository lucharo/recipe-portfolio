servings: 4
ingredients:
- 2 aubergines, halved
- 2 tbsp tahini
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 lemon juiced
- 3 tbsp parsley, chopped (optional)
- 1/4 tsp salt
methods:
  - Cook the aubergines in the oven face down for 30 minutes
  - Take the aubergines out and scoop the flesh out with a spoon into a bowl, discard the skin
  - Add all ingredients into the bowl and combine with a fork
  - Using scissors, make rough cuts to the aubergine mix to reach your desired consistency. I like quite a fine texture but with still bits of aubergine for texture
notes:
  - You can also use a blender to combine all the ingredients but I prefer to use scissors to have different textures in the dish
