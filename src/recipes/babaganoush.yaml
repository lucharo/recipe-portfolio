methods:
- Cut aubergines in half
- Cook the aubergines in the oven face down for 30 minutes
- Take the aubergines out and scoop the flesh out with a spoon into a bowl, discard
  the skin
- Cut garlic cloves finely and juice the lemon
- Add all ingredients into the bowl and combine with a fork
- Using scissors, make rough cuts to the mix to reach your desired consistency. I
  like quite a fine texture but with still bits of aubergine for texture
notes:
- You can also use a blender to combine all the ingredients but I prefer to use scissors
  to have different textures in the dish
