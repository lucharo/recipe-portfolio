methods:
- Dice onions and garlic and finely chop (or grate) ginger until you get paste
- Combine all spices into a spice mix.
- Put oil in a pot, once hot, add onions.
- Once the onions have browned, add garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant (add
  more oil if necessary). Stir and make sure the content of the pot does not stick
  to the bottom.
- Add the spice mix into the pot and stir until combined. Again, try and prevent sticking
  to the bottom.
- Add water to the pot and mix, make sure to scratch the bottom of the pot with a
  wooden spoon to avoid burning at the bottom.
- Add the red lentils, tomatoes, and coconut milk to the pot.
- Bring the mix to a boil and stir throughout.
- Once boiling, bring down to a simmer, cover and let it cook for 15-20 minutes.
notes:
- DO NOT scale chilli flakes linearly with the servings scaling
- I don't soak my red lentils but rinsing them can be a good idea
- Keep stirring initially as onions have a tendency to stick to the bottom and might
  burn your whole dahl
