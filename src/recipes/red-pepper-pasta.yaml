methods:
- "Preheat the oven to 180\xB0C."
- Transfer the cashews to a bowl and cover in hot water straight from a kettle. Leave
  on one side to soak.
- Remove the stem of the red peppers and cut the onion(s) in quarters.
- Add the red peppers to a roasting tray and roast for 15 minutes.
- Remove the tray from the oven. Add the quartered onions and garlic cloves and return
  to the oven for another 15 minutes.
- Cook the pasta in boiling salted water as per packet instructions and make sure
  you reserve some pasta water (1 cup for every 4 servings of this dish).
- Leave the roasted veggies to cool for 5 minutes. Then peel the onion and garlic,
  and remove any skin and any remaining stalks or seeds from the red peppers. Transfer
  them to a blender.
- Drain the cashews and add them to the blender, along with the plant-based milk and
  pasta water you reserved earlier, dried mixed herbs, sun-dried tomatoes (drain as
  much oil as possible), balsamic vinegar, nutritional yeast, and very generous pinches
  of salt and pepper
- Blend until smooth.
- Pour the sauce into a large saucepan on a low-medium heat. Gently heat the sauce,
  then add the spaghetti.
- Top with basil, toasted cashews, and chilli flakes.
notes:
- If you don't have dried mixed herbs, use something like oregano or thyme
