methods:
- "Preheat the oven to 230\xB0C fan / 400\xB0F."
- Transfer the cashews to a bowl and cover in hot water straight from a kettle. Leave
  to one side to soak.
- Add the red peppers to a roasting tray and roast for 15 minutes.
- Remove the tray from the oven. Add the quartered onions and garlic cloves and return
  to the oven for another 15 minutes.
- Cook the pasta in boiling salted water as per packet instructions and make sure
  you reserve some pasta water.
- Leave the roasted veggies to cool for 5 minutes. Then peel the onion and garlic,
  and remove any skin, stalks, and seeds from the red peppers. Transfer them to a
  blender.
- Drain the cashews and add them to the blender, along with the plant-based milk,
  250ml (1 cup) of pasta water you reserved earlier, dried mixed herbs, sun-dried
  tomatoes (drain as much oil as possible), balsamic vinegar, nutritional yeast, and
  very generous pinches of salt and pepper. Blend until smooth.
- Pour the sauce into a large saucepan on a low-medium heat. Gently heat the sauce,
  then add the spaghetti.
- Top with basil, toasted cashews, and chilli flakes.
