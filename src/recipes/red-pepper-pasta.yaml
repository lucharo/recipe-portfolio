servings: 4
ingredients:
  - 4 red peppers
  - 1 onion, quartered
  - 4 garlic cloves
  - 50g cashews
  - 320g spaghetti
  - 250ml unsweetened plant-based milk
  - 1 tbsp dried mixed herbs
  - 50g sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained
  - 1 tsp balsamic vinegar
  - 3 tbsp nutritional yeast
  - salt and pepper
  - fresh basil, toasted cashews, and red chilli flakes for topping
methods:
  - Preheat the oven to 230°C fan / 400°F.
  - Transfer the cashews to a bowl and cover in hot water straight from a kettle. Leave to one side to soak.
  - Add the red peppers to a roasting tray and roast for 15 minutes.
  - Remove the tray from the oven. Add the quartered onions and garlic cloves and return to the oven for another 15 minutes.
  - Cook the pasta in boiling salted water as per packet instructions and make sure you reserve some pasta water.
  - Leave the roasted veggies to cool for 5 minutes. Then peel the onion and garlic, and remove any skin, stalks, and seeds from the red peppers. Transfer them to a blender.
  - Drain the cashews and add them to the blender, along with the plant-based milk, 250ml (1 cup) of pasta water you reserved earlier, dried mixed herbs, sun-dried tomatoes (drain as much oil as possible), balsamic vinegar, nutritional yeast, and very generous pinches of salt and pepper. Blend until smooth.
  - Pour the sauce into a large saucepan on a low-medium heat. Gently heat the sauce, then add the spaghetti.
  - Top with basil, toasted cashews, and chilli flakes.
