methods:
- With a pestle and mortar (ideally) crack lemongrass stalk
- With a pesttle and mortar crush garlic and chiles
- Prepare galangal, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms and baby corn
- "Heat a large pot over medium high heat, add oil and saut\xE9 onion and aromatics"
- Bring water to a boil in a separate pot and cook noodles to their specification,
  drain once they're ready
- Add water and veg stock cubes to the pot and boil
- Add mushrooms, baby corn, tomatoes, sugar, fish or soy sauce and salt to taste
- Simmer for 5 minutes
- Mix in lime juice, coconut milk and chili paste/sauce
- Cook soup for another 7-8 minutes for flavors to infuse
- (optional) Remove inedible aromatics
- Serve hot with more lime juice and cilantro if desired
notes:
- Fresh cilantro for garnish
- Squeeze lime juice to squeeze for garnish
- For the rice noodles I use the Udon Noodles by Yutaka (https://yutaka.london/products/noodles/udon-noodles-250g/)
- If not using babycorn, feel free to replace babycorn for more mushrooms
- I like to cook the soup and noodles separately to have the option to have the soup
  on its own or with noodles
